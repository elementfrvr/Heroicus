The goal of this project is to create an insurance agent management application in Java.
This app will use JavaFX for a User interface, and MySQL for database storage, along with JDBC to connect to the database.

It is being developed using a MAMP local SQL database, however, it is capable of connecting to external databases through slight modification.
